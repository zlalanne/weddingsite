            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>Nicole and Zack grew up together in Richardson, TX. Even though they "met" in 2002 it took awhile before
            they finally got engaged.</p>
            <p>After they both graduated with their bachelors degrees Zack moved back to Dallas, TX to start a new
            job as a Software Engineer at Texas Instruments. During this time Nicole continued work on her masters.
            Once Nicole finished up her Masters in Education, Zack finally decided to pop the question.</p>
            <p>Days after getting engaged the couple packed up and headed to Uganda to work with a local orphanage and
            with the Batwa Pygmies. They had a great time together and once they got back home started to plan the wedding!</p>

                <h2>Matron of Honor</h2>
                <img class="photo" src="{% static "images/jackie.png" %}"/>
                <p>Jackie is Nicole's older sister and matron of honor. Jackie and Nicole have been through thick and
                    thin together, from plane rides to Midland every other weekend in their childhood to arguing over
                    borrowed clothing in their teenage years (and still somewhat today...). Years later, Jackie moved
                    to Gunter with her husband Corey and two dogs Maggie and Riley. Jackie and Corey then gave us our
                    newest addition, Brennen, almost two years ago. Today, Jackie and Nicole spend most of their time
                    together gabbing and eating good food. Nicole admires Jackie's outgoing and charismatic personality
                    that draws in all people within a ten foot radius.<br><br>
                    Jackie now has the time-consuming, but rewarding job of not only caring for her own family's needs,
                    but also a family in Frisco, for which she nannies.

                <img class="photo" src="{% static "images/zackandjake.png" %}"/>
                <p>Jake is Zack's younger brother and best man. Zack tries to look out for his younger brother and even
                    got Jake his first job and his first car, but both ended badly. Although he lives in Denver, whenever they are together they
                    make the most of the time they have, which usually includes playing video games and drinking beer. Zack
                    admires Jake's work ethic and has accepted the fact that he never will be able to cook a steak or bake a
                    cheesecake as well as he can.
                    <br><br>Jake is currently a chef at a cajun restaurant in downtown Denver.

                <p>Kaitlin is one of Nicole's college friends. Kaitlin and Nicole played soccer together at Austin
                    College for three years where Nicole's revered Kaitlin's amazing "Camo Keeper" skills. When Nicole
                    and Kaitlin weren't too busy studying, they bonded over a some well-known college games, like card
                    and "pong" games. While Nicole was studying abroad in Germany, Kaitlin visited her and they painted
                    their faces to watch the U.S. women's soccer team play Sweden in the Women's World Cup 2011. Kaitlin
                    and Nicole both moved to Dallas for work and now spend most of their time together at low-key
                    restaurants and bars in Addison and Lower Greenville.<br><br>Kaitlin now works in Addison as an
                    account executive for MetLife and gets the opportunity to name many rental cars as she travels all
                    over Texas and Oklahoma for work. </p>

                <p>Tyler is one of Zack's oldest friends, going all the way back to the second grade. Together they went
                    on many annual Stillwater trips and got sleep deprived at weekend film races. After high school they
                    went off to the University of Texas together and survived being roommates. <br><br>
                    Tyler is now plotting revenge on Zack's triumphant victory as fantasy football champion.</p>

                <p>Ashleigh is also one of Nicole's college friends and old teammates. They played for the Roos for
                    three years and Ashleigh dominated the defensive third of the field each year. Ashleigh and Nicole's
                    friendship blossomed from their shared weirdness and love for shenanigans, such as: freezing
                    underwear, bathroom mirror messages and sabotaging each other in any way possible while living
                    together. Ashleigh now lives in Austin and Ashleigh and Nicole make the trek to see each other as
                    often as their time and money permits. <br><br>Ashleigh is currently finishing up her masters degree
                    in public health at the University of Texas at Austin and applying to medical schools in Texas. </p>

                <p>Gib is another old friend of Zack who he has known most of his life. Gib and Zack bonded over their
                constant listening to Brand New and playing obscure high school sports. Conversations are now mostly
                filled with talk of good beer and new tech along with the occasional BIG XII trash talk.<br><br>
                Gib is now a professor at a college that has Bears on campus and will probably be a part of the next
                big thing.</p>

                <p>Mackenzie is yet another one of Nicole's college friends and teammates. While Mackenzie wore Austin
                    College's crimson and gold colors, she used her dizzying speed on the flank of the soccer field to
                    up her stats in assists and goals. Mackenzie and Nicole also lived together during their college
                    career. Nicole most enjoyed Mackenzie's ability to beautifully interpret songs through dance with
                    Ashleigh.<br><br>Mackenzie is now finishing up her law degree at Alabama. She plans to return to
                    Texas to take the bar, so if you're look for a very capable lawyer, look no further!</p>
